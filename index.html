    <h1 class="party">Hello GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>This is my new blog. I've started it to have a place to publish my thoughts and learn jQuery, along with JavaScript in general.</p>
    <p>I've been in San Francisco for approximately two months. I'm seeking work as a Junior Rails Developer, or as a Front End Developer.</p>
    <p>It's taken me a little while to get acclimiated but I feel as though I could make a living here and enjoy it. I really like being able to live
in walkable city that's also the heart of the tech scene, where creative people get together to form great companies that change the world.</p>
    <p>Watch this space as it will be updated frequently.</p>
    <p>It's time to <strong class="party">publish some pages.</strong></p>
