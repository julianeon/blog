    <h1 class="party">Julian's Blog</h1>
    <p>This is my new blog. I've started it to have a place to publish my thoughts and learn jQuery, along with JavaScript in general.</p>
    <p>I've been in San Francisco for approximately two months. I'm seeking work as a Junior Rails or a Front End Developer.</p>
    <p>It's taken me this long to get acclimated but I feel as though I could live here and enjoy it. I really like being able to live
in a walkable city, a city that's the beating heart of the tech scene, where creative people get together to change the world.</p>
    <p>Watch this space as I'll update it.</p>
    <p>It's time to <strong class="party">publish some pages.</strong></p>
